### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Joseph Stefanoni. I have just graduated with a Bachelor's of Engineering in Computer Engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology as of May, 2025. I also graduated with a minor in Software Engineering. I have a big interest in Robotics Engineering and Embedded Engineering. On this github page, you will find projects that are from both outside of college as well as from my time during college. These are only a small list of all of the projects that I have worked on.
